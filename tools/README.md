# GTFS -> GeoJSON Stops Pipeline (Cyprus)

This project provides a ready-to-run Python script to aggregate multiple GTFS static feeds (zips), harmonize stop identifiers,
enrich stops with route information, and export a GeoJSON FeatureCollection suitable for mapping applications (Leaflet, Mapbox, etc.).

See generate_stops_geojson.py for usage examples. The script supports reading local ZIP files or downloading feeds from a URL list.
